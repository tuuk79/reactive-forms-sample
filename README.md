This was built to learn and get an understanding of how reactive forms work in an Angular app.  I was particularly interested in reactive forms over template-driven or model-driven forms (aka the ones based on ngModel).  In one post, Todd Motto mentioned using template-driven or model-driven forms are harder to test.  I'm a big proponent of TDD or at least making your components testable, so I thought reactive forms were best for my style of development.
